# pg_deribit - Deribit API Wrapper for PostgreSQL

This project provides a PostgreSQL wrapper for the Deribit API, enabling easy interaction with Deribit's cryptocurrency trading platform from PostgreSQL.

It's designed for developers and data analysts who want to integrate Deribit's features into PostgreSQL-based applications or perform complex data analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Deribit account](https://www.deribit.com/) (Production or Testnet)
- [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html)

### PostgreSQL Version

This extension is built for PostgreSQL 18 and requires the [Omnigres](https://github.com/omnigres/omnigres) extensions (`omni_http` and `omni_httpc`).

## Quickstart

Run the following commands to start a fresh container using the pre-built image:

```bash
# stop and remove any existing container called pg_deribit
docker stop pg_deribit 2>/dev/null || true
docker rm -f pg_deribit 2>/dev/null || true

# pull and run the latest image from GitHub Container Registry
docker run -d --name pg_deribit -p 5433:5432 \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=deribitpwd \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=deribit \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=deribit \
  ghcr.io/rosssaunders/pg_deribit:latest

# connect to the container
PGPASSWORD=deribitpwd psql -h localhost -p 5433 -U deribit -d deribit

# load the extension
create extension if not exists pg_deribit cascade;

# test the extension
select currency
from deribit.public_get_currencies()
order by currency;

# exit the container
\q
```

Connect using your favourite Postgres GUI and get going. For how to use it, see the examples in the doc folder.

## Building from Source

If you want to build the Docker image from source (for development or customization):

git clone https://github.com/rosssaunders/pg_deribit
cd pg_deribit

# build the Docker image
docker build . -t pg_deribit

# run the container
docker run -d --name pg_deribit -p 5433:5432 \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=deribitpwd \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=deribit \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=deribit \
  pg_deribit

# connect to the container
PGPASSWORD=deribitpwd psql -h localhost -p 5433 -U deribit -d deribit
```
